# Notificator

**Notificator** is a crossâ€‘platform Flutter desktop/mobile app (Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS) that shows random notifications from a `.txt` file at userâ€‘defined intervals.  
It runs silently in the system tray and lets you configure the title and delay of notifications.

## Features

- **Customizable notifications** â€“ Reads random lines from `Notificator.txt` and shows them as reminders.
- **Settings screen** â€“ Change notification title and delay (seconds).
- **Persistence** â€“ User settings are saved locally with `shared_preferences`.
- **Tray support** â€“ App hides to tray (Windows/Linux) and can be reopened by clicking tray icon.
- **Auto-create file** â€“ If `Notificator.txt` does not exist, it is created automatically.
- **Custom icons** â€“ App and tray icons are provided (`AppIcon.png`/`AppIcon.ico`).
